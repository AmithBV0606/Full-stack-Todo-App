# Full-stack-Todo-App

### This project contains a simple Todo Application 

### It has the following features - 
    - Anyone can create a Todo.

    - Anyone can see their existing Todos.

    - Anyone can mark a todo as done.

__NOTE(For myself) :__ Whenever you're building a Full-stack project, you always should begin with building the backend first and then the frontend.
